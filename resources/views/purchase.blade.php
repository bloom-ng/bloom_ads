            <strong>Purchases Automatically Renew Until You Cancel & How to Cancel Your Purchase</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            All amounts are payable and charged: (i) for daily commission determined by your spending, at the time you
            place your order; and (ii) for monthly subscriptions, and, because each such subscription renews
            automatically for an additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term until you cancel
            it, at the time of each renewal until you cancel, using the Payment Information you have provided. If you do
            not make any ads spending from the account, you do not oblige to pay any daily commission fee. You must
            cancel your monthly subscription before it renews to avoid the billing of the fees for the next subscription
            period. You can cancel the Purchase at any time by contacting us by email at <a href="#"
