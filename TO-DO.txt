Create ad account model and connect with API for the select platform 
and Timezone inputs...USER

Organisations model for ADMIN, so admin can list all Orgs

for each user, it should have the Org button(among the other 
action buttons of edit, status)..that sends them to a screen 
that pulls organizations for that useradmin/user/id/organisations

Admin edit profile should exist too(where they can change password)

the Organisational multitenancy should be implemented for the user, 
so that each user can only see and manage the organisations they are 
assigned to and they can switch between them in the settings.


Admin should be able to manage ad accounts(list delete edit[update the ad itself]) 
within an organisation....while in the org section, show org(sam cars)
and action of view ads(that lists all ads for that org) and lets admin delete edit
(update the ad itself).....view org users or ads accounts(dropdown)

 ad accounts from admin
